## Overview
Profiler which potentially will use thread and page migration in order to improve efficiency in multi-threaded applications in NUMA systems. It uses PEBS sampling to obtain information from hardware counters so it can analyze system's performance and make choices to improve it.

I am also doing a R source file which plots graphics a heatmap generated by the application, consisting in memory page addresses vs core, with mean/max/min/number of latency accesses as data from 4 different CSV files.

Application originally created by Óscar García Lorenzo. Currently maintained by me.

## Execution flow
* All begins in my_profiler.c. Obtains sample data into two lists (memory_list and inst_list).
* [TODO]

## Compiling and executing
It requires libnuma-dev installed. It also used libpfm but it is included in the app. For compiling and executing, go to the source code folder and just execute "test" script:
```bash
bash test.sh
```

## License
Private, for now.
